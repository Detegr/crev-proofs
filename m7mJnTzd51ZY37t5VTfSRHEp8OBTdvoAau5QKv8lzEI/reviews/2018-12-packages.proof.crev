comment: "Essentially implements `!`-type for stable Rust. `!`-type is preferred to `Void`, but it is currently unstable. No unsafe code, simple implementation that can be read through in minutes. In nightly Rust, this type could be an alias for `!`, see (https://github.com/reem/rust-void/issues/13), but unfortunately it is not implemented."
